# About Problems #

I think it would infringe the copyrights to copy the problems here but I will provide links to them. As I started solving these questions I started with quite old ones. But now I work on the latest problems -however they seem to be more difficult :)-. Latest ones will be relatively less complicated to view (older prob. descriptions are in a zip file with various other problems).
